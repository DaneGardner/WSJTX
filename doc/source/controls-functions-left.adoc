* A drop-down list of bands at upper left lets you select the
operating band and sets dial frequency to a value taken from
the *Default Frequencies* tab on the *Setup | Configuration* screen.
If CAT control is active the radio's dial frequency will be set
accordingly; if not, you must tune the radio manually.

* If you are using CAT control, a small colored square appears in
green if the CAT control is two-way between _WSJT-X_ and your radio, or
orange if the control is only from program to radio.  (You can request
a one-time interrogation of the radioâ€™s dial frequency by clicking on
the orange square.) The square becomes red if you have requested CAT
control but communication with the radio has been lost.  If the
locator *Dx Grid* is known, the great-circle azimuth and distance are
displayed.

* The program can maintain a database of callsigns and locators for
future reference.  Click *Add* to insert the present call and locator
in the database; click *Lookup* to retrieve the locator for a
previously stored call.
