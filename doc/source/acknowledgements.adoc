// Status=review

Since 2005 the _WSJT_ project (including programs _WSJT_, _MAP65_,
_WSPR_, _WSJT-X_, and _WSPR-X_) has been ``open source'', with all
code licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL).  Many users of these
programs, too numerous to mention here individually, have contributed
suggestions and advice that have greatly aided the development of
_WSJT_ and its sister programs.

For _WSJT-X_ in particular, we acknowledge contributions from *AC6SL,
AE4JY, DJ0OT, G4KLA, G4WJS, K3WYC, KA6MAL, KA9Q, KB1ZMX, KI7MT, KK1D,
PY2SDR, VK3ACF, VK4BDJ, W4TI, and W4TV*.  Each of these amateurs has
helped to bring the programâ€™s design, code, and documentation to its
present state.

Most of the color palettes for the _WSJT-X_ waterfall were copied from
the excellent, well documented, open-source program _fldigi_, by *W1HKJ*
and friends.
