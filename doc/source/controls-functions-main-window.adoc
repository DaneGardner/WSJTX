The following buttons appear just under the decoded text windows on
the main screen:

//.Main UI Controls

* *Log QSO* pops up a confirmation screen pre-filled with known
information about a QSO you have nearly completed.  You can edit or
add to this information before clicking *OK* to log the QSO.  If you
check *Prompt me to log QSO* on the *Setup* menu, the program will
raise the confirmation screen automatically when you send a 73 or
free-text message.

* *Stop* will terminate normal data acquisition in case you want to
freeze the waterfall or open and explore a previously recorded audio
file.

* *Monitor* restarts normal receive operation.  This button is
highlighted in green when the _WSJT-X_ is receiving.

* *Erase* clears the right-hand decoded text window. Double-clicking
Erase* clears both text windows.

* *Decode* tells the program to repeat the decoding procedure at the
Rx frequency ([green]*GREEN* marker on waterfall), using the most recently
completed sequence of Rx data.  

* *Enable Tx* puts the program into automatic T/R sequencing mode
and highlights the button in [red]*RED*.  A transmission will start at the
beginning of the selected (odd or even) sequence, or immediately if
appropriate.  A transmission will not be started any later than 24 s 
into a UTC minute.

* *Halt Tx* terminates a transmission in progress and disables
automatic T/R sequencing.

* *Tune* may be used to switch into Tx mode and generate an
unmodulated carrier at the specified Tx frequency ([red]*RED* marker
on waterfall).  This process may be useful for adjusting an antenna
tuner.  The button is highlighted in [red]*RED* while *Tune* is
active.  Toggle the button a second time to terminate the *Tune*
process.
