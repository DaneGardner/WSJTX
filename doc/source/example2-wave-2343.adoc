* The waterfall and main window should look like the figure below.
This sample file contains 17 decodable signals â€” nine in JT65 mode
(flagged with the character # in the decoded text windows), and eight
in JT9 mode (flagged with @).  Since the Tx mode was set to Tx JT65,
signals in that mode were decoded first.  If you had selected Tx JT9,
JT9 signals would have been decoded first.

TIP: Notice the [blue]*BLUE* marker on the waterfall scale, by
default set at 2500 Hz.  Its position is set by the spinner control
JT65 nnnn JT9, where nnnn is a frequency in Hz. In JT9+JT65 mode the
program will decode JT65 signals below this frequency and JT9 signals
above it.

- Confirm that mouse-click behavior is similar to that described in
the single-mode instructions at <<X13,Decoding Controls>>. The program
automatically determines the mode of each JT9 or JT65 signal.
