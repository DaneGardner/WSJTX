Utility programs +jt9code+ and +jt65code+ let you explore the
conversion of user-level messages into channel symbols or ``tone
numbers,'' and back again into user-readable text.  These programs can
be especially useful to someone designing a beacon generator for JT9
or JT65, or for studying behavior of the error-control codes.

Channel-symbol values for JT9 run from 0 to 8, with 0 representing the
sync tone.  The total number of symbols is 85.  To run +jt9code+,
enter the program name followed by a JT9 message enclosed in quotes.
In Windows the result might look like this:

 C:\WSJTX> jt9code "G0XYZ K1ABC FN42"
 Message:   G0XYZ K1ABC FN42
 Channel symbols:
  0 0 7 3 0 3 2 5 4 0 1 7 7 7 8 0 4 8 8 2 2 1 0 1 1 3 5 4 5 6
  8 7 0 6 0 1 8 3 3 7 8 1 1 2 4 5 8 1 5 2 0 0 8 6 0 5 8 5 1 0
  5 8 7 7 2 0 4 6 6 6 7 6 0 1 8 8 5 7 2 5 1 5 0 4 0
 Decoded message: G0XYZ K1ABC FN42

For the corresponding program +jt65code+ only the information-carrying
channel symbols are shown, and the symbol values range from 0 to 63.
Sync synbols lie two tone intervals below data tone 0, and the
sequential locations of sync symbols are described in the
<<JT65PRO,JT65 Protocol>> section of this Guide.


A typical execution of jt65code is shown below.  The program displays
the packed message of 72 bits (shown as 12 six-bit symbol values),
followed by the channel symbols:

 C:\WSJTX> jt65code "G0XYZ K1ABC FN42"
 Message:   G0XYZ K1ABC FN42
 Packed message, 6-bit symbols:  61 36 45 30  3 55  3  2 14  5 33 40
 Information-carrying channel symbols:
    56 40  8 40 51 47 50 34 44 53 22 53 28 31 13 60 46  2 14 58 43
    41 58 35  8 35  3 24  1 21 41 43  0 25 54  9 41 54  7 25 21  9
    62 59  7 43 31 21 57 13 59 41 17 49 19 54 21 39 33 42 18  2 60
 Decoded message: G0XYZ K1ABC FN42

For an interesting illustration of the power of the strong
error-control coding in JT9 and JT65, try looking at the channel
symbols after changing a single character in the message.  For
example, change the grid locator from FN42 to FN43:

 C:\Users\joe\wsjt\wsjtx_install>jt65code "G0XYZ K1ABC FN43"
 Message:   G0XYZ K1ABC FN43
 Packed message, 6-bit symbols:  61 36 45 30  3 55  3  2 14  5 33 41
 Information-carrying channel symbols:
    25 35 47  8 13  9 61 40 44  9 51  6  8 40 38 34  8  2 21 23 30
    51 32 56 39 35  3 50 48 30  8  5 40 18 54  9 24 30 26 61 23 11
     3 59  7  7 39  1 25 24  4 50 17 49 52 19 34  7  4 34 61  2 61
 Decoded message: G0XYZ K1ABC FN43

You will discover that every possible JT65 message differs from every
other possible JT65 message in at least 52 of the 63
information-carrying channel symbols.
