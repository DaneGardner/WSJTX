- Notice the [green]*GREEN* and [red]*RED* markers on the waterfall
frequency scale.  Decoding takes place at the end of a receive
sequence and is organized in two stages.  The first decodes take place
at the selected Rx frequency, indicated by the green marker.  Results
appear in both the left (“Band Activity”) and right (“Rx Frequency”)
text windows on the main screen. The decoder then finds and decodes
all signals in the selected mode(s) and the displayed frequency range.
The red marker indicates your Tx frequency.

.Signal Presence

TIP: At least eight JT9 signals are present in the example file; all
but one of them are decodable.  When this file was recorded KF4RWA was
finishing a QSO with K1JT.  Since the green marker was placed at his
audio frequency, 1224 Hz, his message “K1JT KF4RWA 73” appears in both
decoded text windows.  The “Band Activity” window shows this message
as well as all the other decodes at nearby frequencies.  The CQ lines
are highlighted in [green]*GREEN*, and lines containing “My Call”, in
this case K1JT, are highlighted in [red]*RED*.

- For this step and the next, you may want to pretend you are K1JT by
entering that call temporarily as “My Call” on the <<X11,Configuration
Screen>>.  Your results should then be identical to those shown in the
<<X12,figure above>>.
