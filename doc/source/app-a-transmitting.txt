- Immediately before the start of a transmission {wsjtx} encodes a
userâ€™s message and computes the sequence of tones to be sent.  The
transmitted audio waveform is computed on-the-fly, with 16-bit integer
samples at a 48000 Hz rate.  The digital samples are converted to an
analog waveform in the sound card or equivalent USB interface.
