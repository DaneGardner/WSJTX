.Rig Specific Configuration

- Some rigs work with DTR, RTS, Polling, CaT, PTT while others do
not. The number of possible combinations is virtually endless.

- The intent of this Appendix is to provide configuration information
for specific rigs model, e.g. Icom 756 Pro-III, Yaesu FT-1000MP,
Flex-5000, etc. in order to make Installation & Configuration
easier. This is a work-in-progress. Some rigs may never be covered,
but we should try to cover many as possible.

- The table below will link brands (Yaesu, Icom, Kenwood, etc) to
specific models within each brand. If a model is not available, please
consider drafting a configuration file (a simple text file), using the
template provided, and submit it to the development team for inclusion
to future documentation releases.

NOTE: If your manufacturer is not listed, it means we do not have
configuration files for any of the models for that particular
manufacturer.  Please consider using the Rig Template and submit to
the development team at: {devemail}
