// Status=review

- Installation packages for Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, 13.04, 13.10 are
maintained by AC6SL and available at {launchpadurl}.

- If you have not before obtained packages from the Personal Package
Archive (PPA) at the above link, open a terminal window and execute
the following command:

 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jnogatch/wsjtx

- Accept the PPA Key, then issue these commands:

 sudo apt-get update 
 sudo apt-get install wsjtx

- Download the soft-decision Reed Solomon decoder, {kvasd}, and put it
in the same directory as the executable binaries +wsjtx+ and
+jt9+. Normally (after you have run the script +/usr/bin/wsjtx+ at
least once) this directory will be +$HOME/.wsjtx+.

// Add instructions about ntpd and sound setup.
