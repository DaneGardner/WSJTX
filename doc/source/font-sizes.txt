- User control of font sizes can be effected by using a text editor
(Windows Notepad or similar) to create a one-line file named fonts.txt
in the wsjtx directory. A single line of text should contain four
numbers separated by spaces.  The first two control the font size (in
points) and weight (on a 0 â€“ 100 scale) of most GUI labels. The last
two numbers control size and weight of text in the Band Activity and
Rx Frequency windows.

- The default is ``8 50 10 50''. If you need larger fonts and bold
text in the decode windows, try ``10 50 12 100'' (without the quotes).
