- Execute the downloaded file and follow its installation 
instructions.

- Install {wsjtx} into its own directory rather than the conventional
C:\Program Files\WSJTX.  The suggested default directory is C:\WSJTX.

- All files relating to {wsjtx} will be stored in your chosen
installation directory and its subdirectories. You can uninstall
{wsjtx} by removing the installation directory and its contents.

- The built-in Windows facility for time synchronization is usually
not adequate.  We recommend Meinberg NTP: see {ntpsetup} for
downloading and installation instructions.
