Program menus offer many options for configuration and operation.
Nost of the options will be self-explanatory; a few additional details
are provided below.

.Show DXCC entity and worked B4 status

When this option is checked _WSJT-X_ appends some useful information
to all CQ messages displayed in the Band Activity window.  The name of
the DXCC entity is shown, abbreviated if necessary.  Your ``worked
before'' status (according to the log file +wsjtx_log.adi+) is flagged
with a single character and a change of background colour:

[horizontal]
!::  (bright green) -- New DXCC entity
~::  (mid green) -- You have already worked this DXCC entity but not 
this station
 ::  (dull green) -- You have previously worked the calling station

The program does not distinguish between modes, but it does
differentiate between bands.  

This option is mainly intended for use
on non-Windows platforms; Windows users can (and should) use VK3AMA's
excellent {jtalert} utility.

.Requirements:

_WSJT-X_ expects the file +cty.dat+ to be in your installation
directory.  It contains the DXCC data, is regularly updated and can be
downloaded from {cty_dat}.

Your previous history is read from file +wsjtx_log.adi+. This file is
updated every time you log a QSO from _WSJT-X_ (but note that it can
also be erased from the file menu). You can append or overwrite this
file by exporting your QSO history as an ADIF file from another
logging program.  Turning *Show DXCC entity and worked B4 status* off
and on again will cause _WSJT-X_ to re-read the log file.  Very large
log files may cause _WSJT-X_ to slow down while searching for calls.
