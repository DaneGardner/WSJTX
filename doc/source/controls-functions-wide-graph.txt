The following controls appear at the bottom of the Wide Graph window:

* *FFT Bins/Pixel* controls the displayed frequency resolution.  Set
to 1 for the highest possible resolution, or to higher values to
compress the spectral display. Normal operation with a convenient
window size works well at 2 to 8 bins per pixel.

* *N Avg* is the number of successive FFTs to be averaged before
updating the spectral display.  Values around 5 are suitable for
normal JT9 and JT65 operation.

* *Gain* and *Zero* control the scaling and reference level for
waterfall colors.  Values around 0 for both parameters are usually
about right, depending on the input signal level and your own
preferences.

* *JT65 nnnn JT9* sets the dividing point for wide-band decoding of
JT65 and JT9 signals in JT9+JT65 mode.  The decoder looks for JT65
signals below nnnn Hz and JT9 signals above that frequency.

* *Current / Cumulative* controls the graphical display in the bottom
one-third of the Wide Graph window.  ** Current is the average
spectrum over the most recent N Avg FFT calculations.  ** Cumulative
is the average spectrum since the start of the current Rx sequence.

* With the exception of *JT65 nnnn JT9*, controls on the Wide Graph
window affect only the graphical displays â€” they have no effect
on the decoding process.
