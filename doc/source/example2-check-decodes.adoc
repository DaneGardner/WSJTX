- Double-click on the waterfall near 815 Hz: a signal originating
from W7VP will be decoded and appear in the Rx Frequency Box:

.W7VP Decode
[width="70%",cols="3,^3,^3,^4,^4,30",options="header"]
|=================================
|UTC|db|dt|Freq|Mode|Message
|2343|-7|0.3|815|#|KK4DSD W7VP -16
|=================================

- Double-click on the waterfall at 3196 Hz and the program will decode a JT9
message from IZ0MIT:

.IZ0MIT Decode
[width="70%",cols="3,^3,^3,^4,^4,30",options="header"]
|=====================================
|UTC|db|dt|Freq|Mode|Message
|2343|-7|0.3|3196|@|WB8QPG IZ0MIT -11
|=====================================

TIP: Notice that when a signal is decoded in this way the Tx mode
automatically switches to that of the decoded signal.  The Rx and Tx
frequency markers on the waterfall scale resize themselves
accordingly.

- Scroll back in the Band Activity window (if necessary) and
double-click on the message CQ DL7ACA JO40.  The program will set Tx
mode to JT65 and Tx and Rx frequencies to that of DL7ACA, 975 Hz.  If
you had checked *Double-click on call sets Tx Enable* on the Setup menu,
the program would set up to start a QSO with DL7ACA.

- Double-click on the decoded JT65 message CQ TA4A KM37.  The program
will set Tx mode to JT9 and the Rx and Tx frequencies to 3567 Hz.
Youâ€™re now configured properly for a JT9 QSO with TA4A.
