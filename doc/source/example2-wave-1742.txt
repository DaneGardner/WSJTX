- You can immediately see that these data were recorded with a much
narrower Rx bandwidth, roughly 200 to 2600 Hz. If you have no Rx
filter wider than about 2.7 kHz, you will be using data similar to
this sample. For best viewing of such data adjust Bins/Pixel and the
width of the Wide Graph so that only the active part of the spectrum
shows, say 0 to 2600 Hz.  (Re-open the example file after any change
of Bins/Pixel or Wide Graph width, to refresh the waterfall.)  The
signals in this file are all JT9 signals.  To decode them in JT9+JT65
mode youâ€™ll need to move the JT65 nnnn JT9 delimiter down to 1000 Hz
or less.
