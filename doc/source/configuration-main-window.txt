To set the proper level of audio drive from _WSJT-X_ to your radio:

* Click the *Tune* button on the main screen._WSJT-X_ to switch the
radio into transmit mode and generate a steady audio tone. 

* Listen to the generated audio tone using your radio’s Monitor
facility. The tone should be perfectly smooth, with no clicks or
glitches.

* Open the computer’s audio mixer controls for output (“Playback”)
devices and adjust the volume slider downward from its maximum until
the RF output from your transmitter falls by around ten percent.  This
will be a good level for audio drive.

* Alternatively, you can make the same adjustment using the digital
slider labeled *Pwr* at the right edge of the main window.

* Toggle the *Tune* button once more to stop your test transmission.
