To set the proper level of audio drive from {wsjtx} to your radio:

* Click the Tune button on the main screen.{wsjtx} should set the
radio into transmit mode and generate a steady audio tone at the 
amplitude that will be used for a generated JT9 signal.

* Listen to the generated audio tone using your radio’s Monitor
facility. The tone should be perfectly smooth, with no clicks or
glitches.

* Open the computer’s audio mixer controls for output (“playback”)
devices and adjust the volume slider downward from 100% until the RF
output from your transmitter falls by around ten percent.  This will
be a good level for audio drive.

* Alternatively, you can make the same adjustment using the digital
slider labeled *Pwr* at the right edge of the main window.

* Toggle the Tune button once more to stop your test transmission.
