WSJT-X v1.3 seems to run properly in receive mode, with signals appearing on the waterfall, but *Decode* starts later than expected and nothing is decoded.::

Some earlier soundcard drivers fail to work properly at 48 kHz sample
rate, the default in WSJT-X r3590 and above.  You can force _WSJT-X_
to sample at 12000 Hz by inserting two lines at the end of file
+wsjtx.ini+.  Use Windows Notepad to open +wsjtx.ini+, in your
_WSJT-X_ installation directory.  Then copy-and-paste the following
two lines into the file, save the file, and restart _WSJT-X_.

The *Flatten* feature causes my displayed spectrum to curve steeply upward near its edges, before falling where the radio's IF filter cuts off.::

_WSJT-X_ does not expect a steep filter edge within the displayed
passband, except perhaps a low-frequency cutoff below 200 Hz.  Use a
wider IF filter or reduce the displayed passband by decreasing
*Bins/Pixel*, increasing *Start*, and/or reducing the width of the
*Wide Graph*.  You might also need to re-center the filter's passband,
if such control is available.

When I set *Polling interval* to a nonzero value, _WSJT-X_ sometimes terminates abnormally.::

A few radios do not interact properly with the +hamlib+ calls used in
_WSJT-X_.  We are working to resolve these issues.  In the meantime,
you can run with *Polling interval* = 0, or control your radio through
_DX Labs Commander_ or _Ham Radio Deluxe_.
