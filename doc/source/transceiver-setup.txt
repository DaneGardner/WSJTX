.Receiver Noise Level
- Click the Monitor button to return to normal receive operation.
- Set your transceiver to USB (or USB Data) mode.  
- Use the receiver gain control(s) and/or the Windows mixer controls
to set the background noise level to around 30 dB or mid-scale.  If
necessary you can also use the slider next to the scale, but note that
the overall dynamic range will be best with this slider not too far
from its mid-point.

.Bandwidth and Frequency Setting

Taking full advantage of the wide-band, dual-mode capability of
{wsjtx} requires a receiver bandwidth of at least 4 kHz. For example,
on a Kenwood TS-2000 I set *Low Cut* to 200 and *High Cut* to 5000
Hz. Note that most SSB transceivers have a fixed Tx filter that will
not pass audio frequencies higher than about 2700 Hz.  {wsjtx} takes
care of this by using Split mode, receiving with *VFO A* and
transmitting with *VFO B*.  The Tx dial frequency (*VFO B*) is offset
in 500 Hz steps, and the generated audio frequency is adjusted so that
it always falls in the range 1500 – 2000 Hz. With *CAT* and *Split Tx*
enabled on the configuration screen and your transceiver set to 
*Tx Split* mode, frequency control will be handled automatically.  

If your transceiver has only a standard SSB filter you won’t be able
to use more than about 2.7 kHz bandwidth.  You can still have all of
the JT9 sub-band and part of the JT65 sub-band available, however.  On
20m, say, set dial frequency (*VFO A*) to 14.0774 and the *JT9 nnnn JT65*
dividing line at 1600 Hz.  JT9 signals in their conventional sub-band
will then appear at 1600 – 2600 Hz, while JT65 signals will be below
1000 Hz.  Of course, you might prefer to concentrate on one mode at a
time, setting your dial frequency to (say) 14.076 for JT65 and 14.078
for JT9.  Present conventions have the nominal JT9 dial frequency 2
kHz higher than the JT65 dial frequency, and the check-box labeled +2
kHz, just below the band selector, makes the appropriate settings
easy.
