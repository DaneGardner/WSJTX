Start {wsjtx} and Select Configuration from its Setup menu.  Enter
the following information:

- *Call Sign*: <Your Call Sign>
- *Grid*: <Your Maidenhead Locator>
- *PTT method*: choose from RTS, DTR, CAT, VOX, or None.
- *PTT port*: if you will use RTS or DTR, choose a serial port,
- *PSK Reporter*: check to enable sending reception reports to the
{pskreporter} mapping facility.
- *CW ID*: Check to send your callsign in CW after sending 73.
- *CW Interval*: set the time interval for sending your CW identification. 
Default is 0 (never).

{wsjtx} does not implement full transceiver control, but it provides a
way to ensure that {wsjtx} can read and set the radio’s dial
frequency. If you want this capability:

- Check the box Enable CAT
- Select your radio type from a drop-down list
- Select a CAT port (not the same port selected for PTT control)
- Set port parameters for your radio
- If you use {dxlcommander} by DX Lab or {hrd} to control your
transceiver, you can configure {wsjtx} to communicate with the radio
through that program.  Entries for these programs appear at the end of
the drop-down list of supported radios.

For now you should leave *Split Tx* unchecked. If you are using CAT
control, most radios will allow you to set *PTT method* = CAT.  Some
radios support two types of PTT assertion via CAT control: one takes
audio input from the Mic connector, the other from a rear-panel Data
connector.  The simplest CAT configuration sets *Polling interval* = 0
(no polling the radio for dial frequency).  {wsjtx} will then be able
to set the radio’s frequency, but the program will be unaware of
subsequent changes made using the radio’s panel controls.

TIP: If you need an additional item in the list of devices for the
CAT port, edit the configuration file wsjtx.ini and add your
requirement as CATdriver=yourdriver (for example, 
CATdriver=/dev/ttyUSBserial ) in the group of entries marked
[Common].

With most radios you can set *Polling interval* to a small number (say
1 – 3 s) and the program will follow any frequency changes made at the
radio.  Note that you may not be able simultaneously to control your
radio from {wsjtx} and from another program.  Some experimentation may
be required, and you may need to refer to the documentation for your
rig-control software and your radio.  It is best to have the radio and
any interface equipment turned on and connected before starting
{wsjtx}, and to exit the program before turning your equipment off.

- Click the *Test CAT Control* and Test PTT buttons to see that you
have established the desired control of station functions.  _ Select
the devices you will use for Audio input and output.
- Click OK to dismiss the Configuration window.

- {wsjtx} expects your sound card to do its raw sampling at 48000 Hz.
To ensure that this will be so when running under recent versions of
Windows, open the system's Sound control panel and select in turn the
“Recording” and “Playback” options.  Click on Properties, then
Advanced, and select “16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality).”

CAUTION: If you are using a sound card that is also the default device
for Windows sounds, be sure to turn off all such sounds so they are
not transmitted over the air.
