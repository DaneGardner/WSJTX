// Status=review
// Note to developers. The URL http://developer.berlios.de/projects/wsjt/. is
// to a very old src version of WSJT 5.7 or so. WSJTX is not listed at all.
// Also, all the Qt4 stuff is now obsolete, and needs to be updated.

Source code is available from the public repository at {devsvn}. To
compile the program you will need to install the following packages:

- Subversion
- Qt 5.x
- g++
- gfortran or g95
- fftw3
- hamlib
- MinGW (for Windows only)

With Subversion installed, the full source code for _WSJT-X_ can be
downloaded with the command:

  svn co svn://svn.berlios.de/wsjt/branches/wsjtx 

// Need further compiling Instructions
For some basic instructions on building _WSJT-X_ from source code, see the
section <<COMPILING,Compiling WSJT-X>> near the end of this Guide.
