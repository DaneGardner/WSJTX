- Execute the downloaded file and follow its installation 
instructions.

- Install _WSJT-X_ into its own directory rather than the conventional
location +C:\Program Files\WSJTX+.  The suggested default directory is
+C:\WSJTX+.

- All files relating to _WSJT-X_ will be stored in the chosen
installation directory and its subdirectories. You can uninstall
_WSJT-X_ by removing the installation directory and its contents.

- The built-in Windows facility for time synchronization is usually
not adequate.  We recommend Meinberg NTP: see {ntpsetup} for
downloading and installation instructions.  

- _WSJT-X_ expects your sound card to do its raw sampling at 48000 Hz.
To ensure that this will be so when running under recent versions of
Windows, open the system's *Sound* control panel and select in turn the
*Recording* and *Playback* tabs.  Click on *Properties*, then
*Advanced*, and select ``16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality).''

CAUTION: If you are using a sound card that is also the Windows
default audio device, be sure to turn off all Windows sounds so they
are not transmitted over the air.
