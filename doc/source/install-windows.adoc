- Execute the downloaded file and follow its installation 
instructions.

- Install _WSJT-X_ into its own directory rather than the conventional
location +C:\Program Files\WSJTX+.  The suggested default directory is
+C:\WSJTX+.

- All files relating to _WSJT-X_ will be stored in your chosen
installation directory and its subdirectories. You can uninstall
_WSJT-X_ by removing the installation directory and its contents.

- The built-in Windows facility for time synchronization is usually
not adequate.  We recommend Meinberg NTP: see {ntpsetup} for
downloading and installation instructions.
