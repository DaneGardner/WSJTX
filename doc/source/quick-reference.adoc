== Introduction
The purpose of this guide is to provide a quick reference to commonly used
markup-up items for writing the {wsjtx} User Guide. Additional resources and
examples can be found at:

* {asciidoc_help} by {stuart_rackman}
* {asciidoc_questions} by {stuart_rackman}
* {asciidoc_cheatsheet} by {alex_efros}

== Asciidoc Install

For _WSJT-X_ documentation purposes, only (2) dependencies are generally
required:

* Python
* Source highlight

For most packages, the normal method of installation is through their
respective package manager. There are several reasons why we do not
want this for the _WSJT-X User Guide_:

** Most packaged applications are installed system-wide, which means standard
pivilaged (non Root / RootSudo) users update their binaries.
** Often times, distro packages are (1) or more revisions behind.
** Updating to the latest stable _AscciDoc_ version, using Mercurial, is a simple
one line command: _hg pull ; hg update ; hg upgrade_, or clone a new binary
set with _hg clone -r 8.6._ then re-link the new binary.
** Using $HOME makes working on the _WSJT-X User Guide_ portable, such as,
installing to a USB Key and allowing you to test build your work on virtually
any system that has _Python_ {amp}{amp} _Bash Enviroment_ installed.
