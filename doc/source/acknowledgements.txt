// Status=review

Many users of WSJT, too numerous to mention here individually, have
contributed suggestions and advice that have greatly aided the
development of {wsjtx} and its sister programs.  Since 2005 the
overall project (including WSJT, MAP65, WSPR, {wsjtx}, and WSPR-X) has
been “open source”, with all code licensed under the GNU Public
License (GPL).

For {wsjtx} in particular, we acknowledge contributions from *AC6SL,
AE4JY, DJ0OT, G4KLA, G4WJS, K3WYC, KA6MAL, KA9Q, KI7MT, KK1D, PY2SDR,
VK3ACF, VK4BDJ, and W4TV*.  Each of these amateurs has helped to bring
the program’s design, code, and documentation to its present
state. 

Most of the color palettes for the {wsjtx} waterfall were copied from
the excellent, well documented, open-source program _fldigi_, by *W1HKJ*
and friends.
