- {wsjtx} acquires 16-bit integer samples from the sound card at a
12000 Hz rate.  Spectra from overlapping data segments are computed
for the waterfall display and saved at intervals of half the JT9
symbol length.

- As shown in screen shots earlier in this Guide, a *JT9* signal
appears in the Cumulative spectrum as a nearly rectangular shape about
16 Hz wide.  Although there is no clearly visible “sync tone” like the
one in *JT65*, by convention the nominal frequency of a *JT9* signal
is nevertheless taken to be that of the lowest tone at the left edge
of the spectrum.

- At the end of a reception sequence, about 50 seconds into the UTC
minute, received data samples are forwarded to the decoder.  For
operator convenience the decoder goes through its full procedure
twice:

* first over a narrow range around the selected Rx frequency

* Then in the full displayed frequency range (or in *JT9+JT65* mode, the
displayed range above the blue *JT65 nnnn JT9* marker).

- Decoding of clean *JT9* signals in a white-noise background starts
to fail around signal-to-noise ratio –25 dB and reached the 50% level
at -26 dB

- Each decoding pass can be described as a sequence of discrete blocks.
