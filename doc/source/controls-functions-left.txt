* The drop-down *Band* selector at upper left lets you select the
operating band and sets dial frequency to a default value taken from
the *Default Frequencies* tab on the *Setup | Configuration* screen.

* If you are using CAT control, a small colored square appears in
green if the CAT control is two-way between {wsjtx} and your radio, or
orange if the control is only from program to radio.  You can request
a one-time interrogation of the radioâ€™s dial frequency by clicking on
the orange square. The square becomes red if you have requested CAT
control but communication with the radio has been lost.  If the 
*Dx Grid* is known, the great-circle azimuth and distance are given.

* The program can keep a database of call-signs and locators for
future reference.  Click *Add* to insert the present call and locator in
the database; click *Lookup* to retrieve the locator for a previously
stored call.
