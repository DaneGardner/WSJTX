.Rig Specific Configuration

Some rigs work with DTR, RTS, Polling, CAT, and PTT while others do
not. The number of possible combinations is virtually endless.  The
intent of this Appendix is to provide configuration information for
specific rig models, e.g. Icom 756 Pro-III, Kenwood TS-2000, Yaesu
FT-1000MP, Flex-5000, etc., in order to make installation and
configuration easier. This is a work-in-progress, and some rigs may
never be covered.

The table below will link manufacturer names (Icom, Kenwood, Yaesu,
etc.) to specific models within each brand. If a model is not
available, please consider drafting a configuration file (a simple
text file), using the template provided, and submit it to the
development team for inclusion in future documentation releases.

:yaesu: link:yaesu.html[Yaesu]
:rigtemplate: link:rigtemplate.html[Template]

NOTE: If your manufacturer is not listed, it means we do not have
configuration files for any of the models for that particular
manufacturer.  Please consider using the Rig Template and submit to
the development team at: {devmail}
