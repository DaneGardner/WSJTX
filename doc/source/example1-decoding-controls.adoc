- To gain some feeling for the controls you will use when making QSOs, try 
clicking with the mouse on the decoded text lines and on the waterfall spectral 
display. You should be able to confirm the following behavior:

- Double-click on either of the decoded lines highlighted in green. This action
should produce the following:

** Copies call-sign and locater of a station calling CQ to the “DX Call” 
and “DX grid” entry fields.

** Generates suitable messages for a minimal QSO and checks or clears the Tx
even box so that you will transmit in the proper (odd or even) minutes.

** Rx and Tx frequency markers will be moved to the CQ-ing station’s frequency,
and the Gen Msg (“generated message”) radio button at bottom right of the main
window will be selected.

** If you had checked “Double-click on call sets Tx Enable” on the Setup menu,
Enable Tx would also be activated, and you would start to transmit automatically,
at the appropriate time.

- Double-click on the decoded line with the message “K1JT N5KDV EM41”, 
highlighted in [red]*RED*.

- Results will be similar to (a), except the Tx frequency ([red]*RED* marker) is
not moved.  Such messages are usually in response to your own CQ, or from a 
tail-ender, and you probably want your Tx frequency to stay where it was.

- By holding down the Ctrl key when double-clicking on the decoded line 
(or checking Lock Tx=Rx) you can cause both Tx and Rx frequencies to be moved.

- Double-click on the message from KF4RWA in either window. He is 
sending “73” to K1JT, signifying that the QSO is over.  Most likely you 
want to send 73 to him, so the message “KF4RWA K1JT 73” is automatically 
generated and selected for your next transmission.  (Alternatively, you might 
choose to send a free text message or to call CQ again.)

- Clicking on the waterfall moves the Rx frequency ([green]*GREEN* marker) to the 
selected frequency.

- Ctrl-click on waterfall moves both Rx and Tx frequencies.

- Double-click on the waterfall moves the Rx frequency and causes a 
narrow-band decode there at the new QSO frequency. Decoded text appears in the 
right window only.  Ctrl-double-click moves both Rx and Tx frequencies and 
decodes at the new frequency. 

- Clicking Erase clears the right window. Double-click on Erase to clear both 
text windows.
